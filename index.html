        <p>The spring season can also bring with it unstable weather. This happens when the cold air comes from The Polar Regions while the warmth comes from the lower altitudes. The spring season brings with it warm rainfall, which melts the snow formed during winters. This melted snow often results in flooding.

        <p>People who stay inside their homes most of the time during winter start going out during this season, and it is very important to notice the amount of fresh air that we get to breathe in during the season of spring. In addition to all of it, there is an ample amount of sunlight that reaches us during this season, and it is rich in Vitamin D, which is very good for our skin.
